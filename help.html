            <p>Welcome to the help page for Join
                Your guide to using our kanban project management tool. Here, we'll provide an overview of what Join is,
                how it can
                benefit you, and how to use it.</p>

            <h2>What is Join?</h2>
            <p>Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as
                part of their
                web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.</p>
            <p>Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                work-in-progress,
                and maximize efficiency (or flow). Join leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage their
                tasks and
                projects in an intuitive, visual interface.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that Join is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for
                extensive business
                usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent
                availability,
                reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding Join.</p>

            <h2>How to use it</h2>
            <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use Join:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exploring the Board:</strong> When you log in to Join, you'll find a default board. This
                    board
                    represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", "Await feedback"
                    and "Done".
                </li>
                <li><strong>Creating Contacts:</strong> In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects.
                    Go to the
                    "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these
                    contacts can
                    be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.</li>
                <li><strong>Adding Cards:</strong> Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
                    Cards represent
                    individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the
                    task details
                    in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Moving Cards:</strong> As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on
                    the board by
                    dragging and dropping the card from one list to another.</li>
                <li><strong>Deleting Cards:</strong> Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list
                    or delete
                    it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting
                    cards, as
                    this action is irreversible.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Remember that using Join effectively requires consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the
                board reflects
                the current state of your project.</p>

            <h2 style="margin-bottom: 80px;">Enjoy using Join!</h2>
