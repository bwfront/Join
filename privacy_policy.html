                legal basis of the GDPR on the basis of which we process personal data. Please note,
                that, in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your
                or
                our
                country of residence or domicile.
                may apply. Furthermore, should more specific legal bases be relevant in individual cases, we will inform
                you
                of
                these in the
                privacy policy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consent (Art. 6 Abs. 1 S. 1 lit. a) DSGVO)</strong> - The data subject has given his or her
                    consent
                    to the processing of personal data concerning him or her for a specific purpose or several

                <li><strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6 Abs. 1 S. 1 lit. f) DSGVO)</strong> - The processing is
                    necessary
                    to
                    protect
                    the legitimate interests of the controller or of a third party, except where the interests
                    or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require the protection of personal

            </ul>
            <p><strong>National data protection regulations in Germany: </strong>In addition to the data protection
                regulations
                of
                the GDPR
                national regulations on data protection apply in Germany. These include, in particular, the Act for the
                Protection
                against
                Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG). The BDSG contains
                special regulations on the right to information, the right to deletion, the right to object, the
                processing
                of
                processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes, and the transmission

                as well as automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. Furthermore
                State data protection laws of the individual federal states may also apply.</p>
            <p><strong>Reference to validity of DSGVO and Swiss DSG: </strong>This data protection notice serves both to
                information according to the Swiss Federal Law on Data Protection (Schweizer DSG) as well as according
                to
                the
                General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For this reason, we ask you to note that due to the broader
                spatial application and comprehensibility, the terms of the GDPR are used. In particular, instead of the
                terms
                used
                in the
                Instead of the Swiss DPA terms "processing" of "personal data", "overriding interest" and "particularly
                personal data" used in the GDPR, the terms "processing" of "personal data" and "legitimate
                data" as well as "legitimate interest" and "special categories of data" are used. The legal meaning of
                the
                terms will, however, continue to be determined in accordance with the Swiss DPA within the scope of its
                applicability.</p>

            <h2 id="m27">Security measures</h2>
            <p>We make decisions in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art,
                the
                implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing, as well as the
                different
                the different probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of
                natural
                persons.
                appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the
                risk.

            <p>Measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data through
                controlling physical and electronic access to data, as well as the access, input, transfer, availability
                and
                segregation of data.
                access, input, disclosure, availability, and segregation. Furthermore, we have established procedures
                procedures in place to ensure the exercise of data subjects' rights, the deletion of data, and the
                response
                to
                data
                of the data. Furthermore, we already take the protection of personal data into account during the
                development
                and selection of hardware, software and processes in accordance with the principle of data protection,

            <h2 id="m25">Transmission of personal data</h2>
            <p>In the course of our processing of personal data, it happens that the data is transmitted to other

                IT
                tasks or
                Providers of services and content that are integrated into a website. In such cases we observe
                legal requirements and, in particular, conclude appropriate contracts or agreements that serve to
                protect
                your
                data.

                European Economic Area (EEA)) or the processing takes place in the context of the use of third
                services of third parties or the disclosure or transfer of data to other persons, entities or companies,

                in
                the
                third country has been recognized by means of an adequacy decision (Art. 45 DSGVO), this serves as the
                basis
                for
                the
                data transfer. Otherwise, data transfers will only take place if the level of data protection is
                otherwise

                in particular through standard contractual clauses (Art. 46(2)(c) DSGVO), explicit consent or in the
                case of
                contractual or legally required transfer (Art. 49 (1) DSGVO). For the rest, we will inform you of the
                bases of the third country transfer in the case of the individual providers from the third country,
