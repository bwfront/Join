      <h2>Collection of General Information When Visiting Our Website</h2>
      <hr />
      <h3>Nature and Purpose of Processing:</h3>
      <p>
        When you access our website, i.e., when you do not register or otherwise
        transmit information, information of a general nature is automatically
        recorded. This information (server log files) includes the type of web
        browser, the operating system used, the domain name of your Internet
        service provider, your IP address, and similar data.
      </p>
      <p>They are processed for the following purposes in particular:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensuring a seamless connection to the website,</li>
        <li>Ensuring smooth use of our website,</li>
        <li>Evaluating system security and stability, and</li>
        <li>Optimizing our website.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do not use your data to draw conclusions about your person. Information
        of this kind is statistically evaluated by us if necessary, in order to
        optimize our internet presence and the technology behind it.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>Legal Basis and Legitimate Interest:</h3>
      <p>
        Processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR
        based on our legitimate interest in improving the stability and
        functionality of our website.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>Recipients:</h3>
      <p>
        Recipients of the data may be technical service providers who act as data
        processors for the operation and maintenance of our website.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p></p>
      <h3>Storage Period:</h3>
      <p>
        The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary for the
        purpose of collection. This is generally the case for data that serves to
        provide the website when the respective session is terminated.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <hr />
      <h3>Provision Required or Necessary:</h3>
      <p>
        The provision of the aforementioned personal data is neither legally nor
        contractually required. However, without the IP address, the service and
        functionality of our website cannot be guaranteed. In addition, certain
        services and features may not be available or may be restricted. For this
        reason, objection is excluded.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <hr />
      <h2>Contact Form</h2>
      <hr />
      <h3>Nature and Purpose of Processing:</h3>
      <p>
        The data you enter is stored for the purpose of individual communication
        with you. For this purpose, providing a valid email address and your name
        is necessary. This is used for associating the inquiry and subsequently
        responding to it. Providing further data is optional.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>Legal Basis:</h3>
      <p>
        The processing of data entered into the contact form is based on a
        legitimate interest (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR).
      </p>
      <p>
        By providing the contact form, we aim to facilitate uncomplicated contact
        with you. The information you provide will be stored for the purpose of
        processing the inquiry and for possible follow-up questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you contact us to request an offer, the processing of the data entered
        into the contact form is carried out to perform pre-contractual measures
        (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR).
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>Recipients:</h3>
      <p>Recipients of the data may be data processors, if applicable.</p>
      <p></p>
      <hr />
      <h3>Storage Period:</h3>
      <p>
        Data will be deleted no later than 6 months after the inquiry has been
        processed.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a contractual relationship is established, we are subject to the
        statutory retention periods under the German Commercial Code (HGB) and
        will delete your data after the expiration of these periods.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>Provision Required or Necessary:</h3>
      <p>
        The provision of your personal data is voluntary. However, we can only
        process your request if you provide us with your name, email address, and
        the reason for the request.
      </p>

        Information about Your Right to Object Pursuant to Article 21 of the GDPR
      </h2>
      <h3>Individual Right to Object</h3>
      <p>
        You have the right to object at any time, for reasons arising from your
        particular situation, to the processing of your personal data concerning
        you, which is carried out on the basis of Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR
